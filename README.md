# Hi there 👋, I’m **Ranat Das Prangon**

*“We ignore the public understanding of science at our own peril”*

> I’m currently working on a **non-linear drug delivery system for cancer treatment**, combining SMC, ISMC, and Synergetic Controllers, and optimizing performance via a Two-Phased Genetic Algorithm.

## About Me

I am a research-enthusiast and full-stack software developer, with a passion for merging advanced algorithmic methods and experimental control systems. I work on projects that bring together machine learning, control theory, and real-world applications.

## Academic & Research Profile

* I have an active academic profile and contribute to both open-source software and scientific research.
* My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2uWGRC4AAAAJ) / [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ranat-Das-Prangon) profiles further detail my publications, citations and collaborations.
* Development of advanced control algorithms for biomedical systems: focusing on precision, stability and adaptivity.
* Implementation of machine-learning-driven modules in embedded systems and robotics.
* Open-source tools: I share code, notebooks and experiments across domains from deep learning and UAV vision to web applications.

## Skills & Technologies

* **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, MATLAB, C++ (depending on project)
* **Machine Learning / Deep Learning:** CNNs, optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms
* **Control Systems:** Synergetic Controllers, ISMC, non-linear system design
